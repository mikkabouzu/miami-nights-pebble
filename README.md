Large font is [True Lies by Jonathan S. Harris](http://tattoowoo.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=72&products_id=1678). Digits have been exported and used as PNG assets because a few of the characters are way too big for the pebble font rasterizer.

Smaller Date font is [Teko (Open Source)](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Teko).

Uses the [GBitmap-Colour-Palette-Manipulator](https://github.com/rebootsramblings/GBitmap-Colour-Palette-Manipulator) library to dynamically change bitmap image colors for hours and minutes.
